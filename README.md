### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Bahattin

I am a senior software developer who has been coding for ten years. Usually, I am working on web applications on both sides; frontend and backend. I had many chances to work with different languages and technologies from zero to production.

- Experience in Python, Golang, PHP, Javascript, NodeJs, React, React Native, Vue and Kubernetes technologies.
- Having knowledge about AdTech, eCommerce, ERP, Travel Industries.
- Curiosity about distributed systems, scaling, automation.

Also I'm interested in Triathlon. You can check my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/23780087) profile if you are interested.
